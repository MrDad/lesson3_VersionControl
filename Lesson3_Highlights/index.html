            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is the process of saving a new file for every version of a project and keeping these files organized.  Version Control Systems take this process and automate it using software.  
                            These systems are usually stand-alone applications that either periodically check if the file has been changed, and save the changes as a new version, or allow the user to manually push new file 
                            versions when convenient.  Version Control Systems typically have a main repository for all the project files, usually on a server.  This allows for members of a team to easily pull files and push 
                            new versions when needed, while ensuring that simultaneous editing does not cause overwrites or other problems.  On top of these perks, Version Control Sytems allows the user to easily revert back 
                            to previous versions if needed.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Repositories are the back bone of Version Control Systems.  There are two types of repositories within each system; remote repositories and local repositories.  Remote repositories are usually a 
                            server, or group of servers, that are shared by the project team.  The remote repository handles the actual application of version control (saving file versions, backing up files, allowing access 
                            to files, etc.).  Local repositories are the exact opposite.  They are found on the local machine of an individual user.  These are where developers work and make changes.  Anything on a local 
                            repository is not officially part of the project until it is pushed to the remote repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Advantages of VCSs</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems have many advantages for individuals and groups.  Primarily VCSs allow a user to save files or versions of projects without worrying about overwriting previous versions.  
                            VCSs create new versions for each new update.  Following up on the first benefit, VCSs hold the latest version of the files within a common repository.  This repository is available to all users 
                            who have been given access and it holds the latest file versions of the project.  Third, while the common repository holds the latest files, VCSs hold on to older versions of the project.  This 
                            allows for a user to easily revert to a previous version of the file/project if needed.  Along with the ability to revert, VCSs will also backup your work, this ensures that you will not 
                            lose precious work if something wrong occurs.  Finally, and most appealing to large project teams, VCSs allow simultaneous work on the same files, without conflict.</p>

       <!-- Fourth Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic4">

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open source VCS that is widely used distributed version control system.  Git is one of the most used VCSs and is universally known.  There are a couple specifics to why git is 
                            described as distributed.  With git, every user has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally.  Additionally there is no single point of failure with git, ensuring security of files 
                            and ease of mind.  Most importantly, in my opinion, git will prevent overwriting of a file on shared repositories.  This means that if two programmers work on the same section of a file, and both
                            upload their work, git will ensure that the differences do not overwrite each other.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GitHub</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is a web service that provides version control through the use of Git.  GitHub is one of the most highly used web-base hosting services for version control and recently was acquired by 
                            Microsoft.  GitHub is used across the world for both private and public projects.  Infact I have cloned a couple open-source JS projects from GitHub in the past.  GitHubs ease of use and integration
                            with Git are highly beneficial for any developer's workflow.  GitHub allows its users to create repositories, both private or public, and share them with others.  This means that GitHub acts as the 
                            remote repository for any given persons VCS.</p>
